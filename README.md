# Pattern_Drawing_Project_by_Mehmed_Hadzhiyski
This project is designed to draw various patterns based on the users choice.
Some patterns require **rows**, some - **size**, but every pattern can have the following **foreground** colors: ğŸ”´ **red**, ğŸŸ¢ **green**, ğŸŸ¡ **yellow**, ğŸ”µ **blue** and more.
The user can print small, medium and even large patterns ğŸ¤¯! Also, the user has a choice to continue printing patterns!
